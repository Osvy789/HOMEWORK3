To run get into the file in this case part1 or part2 and run on the integrated terminal the following commands: cargo build and cargo run

For part1 I would recommend erasing the log file as all but ALL the operations are logged on it.

Now for part1 I dedicated 1 thread per servant however I tried of thinking of a solution based on the minotaur's requirements but could not think of a design that would also so I just tried of running what but to a greater extend and even repeating if neccesary

For part2 I had 8 threads running but for demonstration purposes they were racing against each other instead of a real demonstration so the values might not be fitting but if you want to wait for a lot that it should last by changing all threads sleep from 1 to 60 it would work as I was able to tested for 3 hours.

Aside from that this was fun for the second one, the first one I basically did what the minotaur said.
